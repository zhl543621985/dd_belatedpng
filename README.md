# pngfix for ie6
A fork of [DD_belatedPNG](http://www.dillerdesign.com/experiment/DD_belatedPNG/).

Please use `dist/DD_belatedPNG_0.0.8a.min.js`, which also includes some logic to fire up the fix using class `.pngfix`. Just add `pngfix` into the classList of any ie6 png backgrounds elements to use it.
